# Getting_and_Cleaning_Data
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. 
The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 
Required to submit: 
1) a tidy data set as described below, 
2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, and 
3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md.  

The dataset being used is: Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones

#What you find in this repository
CodeBook.md: describes the variables. 
averages_data.txt: output of the final step.
run_analysis.R: the code to perform the whole analyses.
